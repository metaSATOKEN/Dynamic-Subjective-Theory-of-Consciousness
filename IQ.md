# \*\*Information-Theoretic Constructivism of Semantic Content (IQ):

From Predictive-Error-Driven Transitions to Multi-Modal Creative Dynamics\*\*

## **Abstract**

The *Information-Theoretic Constructivism of Semantic Content* (IQ) is the second installment in a three-part theoretical and experimental program — *Dynamic Subjective Theory of Consciousness* (DSTC) → IQ → *Interaction-Driven Consciousness Emergence* (IDCE) — aiming to establish a unified, physically grounded, and experimentally verifiable framework for the study of emergent conscious-like processes.
Building directly on the dynamical foundations of DSTC, IQ extends the theory from the *stability* and *phase dynamics* of conscious processes (the “when” and “how” of stable states) to the **semantic content layer** (the “what” is represented).

At its core, IQ introduces a **dual-state representation**:

* **Phase dynamics** capturing temporal coordination across oscillatory elements
* **Semantic vectors** capturing the representational content structure, evolving under predictive-error-driven coupling

Through this dual representation, IQ formalizes the concept of **predictive-error-driven semantic phase transitions**, where the system reorganizes its representational structure in response to mismatch between predicted and observed states. The theoretical contributions are threefold:

1. **Critical Semantic Coupling (\$K\_{\mathrm{sem},c}\$)** — A mathematically rigorous derivation (via mean-field linearization on the unit sphere and tangent space projection) establishing the threshold for semantic consensus.
2. **Multi-modal Extension** — Introduction of a *mixture of von Mises–Fisher (vMF)* semantic order parameter, \$\lambda\_{\mathrm{sem}}^{\mathrm{mix}}\$, enabling the quantitative study of creative states as structured diversity.
3. **Geometric SDE Analysis** — Complete Stratonovich-to-Itô conversion of the sphere-constrained semantic dynamics, including curvature-induced drift and the corresponding Fokker–Planck equation.

The **Phase 3 experimental program** operationalizes these theoretical constructs across four mutually reinforcing empirical axes:

* **AI-based verification** through synchronization-regularized Transformer models with predictive-error-driven semantic dynamics.
* **EEG/MEG-based neurophysiological validation** via detection of “semantic ignition” events aligned with cognitive transitions.
* **Creativity quantification** using the multi-modal vMF framework.
* **Closed-loop feedback efficacy tests** measuring recovery times and stability in perturbed semantic-phase systems.

By integrating mathematically rigorous derivations, fully reproducible simulation code, and cross-domain experimental protocols, IQ establishes itself as a rare *triad-complete* theory:
**Theoretical consistency → Implementation fidelity → Experimental verifiability.**
This positions IQ not only as a standalone contribution to the science of consciousness but also as the conceptual bridge to the forthcoming IDCE framework, where interaction, value, and societal-level emergence become central.

## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 From Stability to Content in the Science of Consciousness**

The study of consciousness has traditionally oscillated between two poles:

* **Ontological inquiries** (“Does X have consciousness?”)
* **Phenomenological descriptions** (“What is it like?”)

While valuable, both approaches often lack a **mechanistic bridge** linking observable physical dynamics to the *content structure* of conscious states.
The *Dynamic Subjective Theory of Consciousness* (DSTC) addressed the first half of this bridge by treating consciousness as a **synchronization phenomenon** with explicit control-theoretic stability mechanisms. DSTC could predict and regulate *when* and *how* a conscious-like process remains stable under noise and perturbation.

However, DSTC intentionally remained **agnostic about the specific representational content** being stabilized. The open question was:

> *Given a stable conscious-like state, what exactly is being represented, and how does that representation reorganize when the world surprises the system?*

IQ directly addresses this gap, shifting the focus from **stability of the conscious process** to **structure of its semantic content**.

### **1.2 The Strategic Position of IQ in the DSTC→IQ→IDCE Trilogy**

The trilogy’s progression can be summarized as:

* **DSTC:** “When” and “how” stability emerges — dynamics, control, and noise-resilience.
* **IQ:** “What” is represented — semantic content, predictive errors, and creative restructuring.
* **IDCE:** “Why” and “for whom” — interaction, value, and social-scale emergence.

IQ thus acts as the *conceptual hinge* between the micro-level dynamics of DSTC and the macro-level socio-cognitive emergence of IDCE. It must preserve DSTC’s physical and mathematical rigor while introducing **operational measures of content** that are both theoretically sound and empirically tractable.

### **1.3 The Core Innovation: Predictive-Error-Driven Semantic Transitions**

In IQ, the semantic layer is modeled as a set of **unit-normalized vectors** \${\mathbf{u}\_i(t)}\$ embedded in \$\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\$ (the unit sphere in \$\mathbb{R}^d\$), each associated with an oscillatory element from the phase layer. These semantic vectors evolve according to a **predictive-error-driven consensus dynamic**:

$$
\frac{d\mathbf{u}_i}{dt} =
K_{\mathrm{sem}}(E_{\mathrm{pred}})\sum_j \tilde{A}_{ij} P_{\mathbf{u}_i}(\mathbf{u}_j - \mathbf{u}_i)
+ \sqrt{2D_{\mathrm{sem}}(E_{\mathrm{pred}})}\,P_{\mathbf{u}_i}\,\xi_i(t)
$$

Here:

* \$E\_{\mathrm{pred}}\$ is the *prediction error*, derived from mismatch between expected and observed outputs.
* \$K\_{\mathrm{sem}}(E\_{\mathrm{pred}})\$ and \$D\_{\mathrm{sem}}(E\_{\mathrm{pred}})\$ are **saturation-controlled gain functions** that respectively reduce coupling and increase diffusion under high error, encouraging exploratory restructuring.
* \$P\_{\mathbf{u}\_i}\$ projects vectors onto the tangent space of the sphere, ensuring normalization.

When \$E\_{\mathrm{pred}}\$ exceeds a critical value, the system may undergo a **semantic phase transition** — reorganizing representational content while maintaining overall process stability.

### **1.4 The Three Theoretical Pillars of IQ**

1. **Critical Coupling Analysis (\$K\_{\mathrm{sem},c}\$):**
   Derived analytically via mean-field approximation and Laplacian spectral analysis, providing explicit dependency on semantic diffusion \$D\_{\mathrm{sem}}\$, embedding dimension \$d\$, and network algebraic connectivity \$\lambda\_2\$.

2. **Multi-Modal Semantic Order Parameter (\$\lambda\_{\mathrm{sem}}^{\mathrm{mix}}\$):**
   Extends the classic von Mises–Fisher order parameter to mixtures, incorporating an entropy term to capture diversity-integration trade-offs — essential for modeling creative cognition.

3. **Geometric SDE Formulation:**
   Full Stratonovich-to-Itô conversion for the sphere-constrained semantic dynamics, revealing the curvature-induced drift term and its role in maintaining uniform invariant measures under pure diffusion.

### **1.5 Phase 3: Closing the Theory–Implementation–Experiment Loop**

IQ’s **Phase 3 experimental architecture** is designed to eliminate the common gap between theory and empirical validation. Four tightly coupled verification axes ensure both domain-specific and cross-domain testability:

1. **AI Verification:** Transformer models with embedded semantic dynamics and synchronization regularization, enabling direct measurement of \$\lambda\$, \$\lambda\_{\mathrm{sem}}\$, and \$E\_{\mathrm{pred}}\$ during training/inference.
2. **Neurophysiological Verification:** EEG/MEG-based detection of “semantic ignition” events via change-point analysis on time-resolved semantic embeddings.
3. **Creativity Quantification:** Applying \$\lambda\_{\mathrm{sem}}^{\mathrm{mix}}\$ to measure structured diversity in cognitive states.
4. **Closed-Loop Efficacy:** Perturbation–recovery experiments to test feedback control efficiency in restoring target semantic-phase states.

This multi-axis design ensures that **IQ is not only mathematically and computationally rigorous but also experimentally falsifiable**, meeting the gold standard for scientific theories of consciousness.
